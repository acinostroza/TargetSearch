Description: This packages provides a flexible, fast and accurate method
    for targeted pre-processing of GC-MS data. The user provides a (often
    very large) set of GC chromatograms and a metabolite library of targets.
    The package will automatically search those targets in the chromatograms
    resulting in a data matrix that can be used for further data analysis.
