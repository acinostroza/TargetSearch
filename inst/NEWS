	and RI correction options gray out when 'Apex data' is selected.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2:

NEW FEATURES

    o	New 'tsProfile' and 'tsMSdata' definitions. Many functions were
	internaly changed to conform to the changes, however, the changes
	should be (more or less) transparent for the user.

    o	classes.R:
	- new 'quantMass' slot in class 'tsLib'
	- class 'tsMSdata': slots changed from matrix to list
	- class 'tsProfile': new slots profInt, profRI and ProfRT

    o	Function FindPeaks: Now the parameter refLib can be either a list
	or a 3-column matrix. If it is a list, the function will iterate for
	every component, given that the components are 3-column matrices.

    o	Function ImportLibrary: code changed to incorporate the 'quantMass'
	slot.

    o	methods-tsLib.R: new methods to access quantMass slot. Also, new
	methods profileInt, profileRI and profileRT to access slots profInt,
	profRI and ProfRT. New method as.list

    o	Write.Results: Same as before, but the parameter peakData was
	removed, since the raw data is now included in the 'tsProfile' object.

    o	The following files were changed to conform to the new definicions.
	No changes in terms of functionality: dayNorm.R, peakFind.R, plot.R,
	profile.R, profileCleanUp.R, and sampleRI.R.

    o	new function quantMatrix.

    o	Changes in the GUI. Now two new parameters are accepted: topMasses
	and ExcludedMasses.

	section at check.
