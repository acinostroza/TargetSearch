		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12.0:

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	New binary file format for the peak-list files, a.k.a. RI files.
	This speeds up metabolite searches by 5-10 fold. The old TEXT format
	is kept for compatibility. See method 'fileFormat'. Also see
	'bin2text' and 'text2bin' funtions.

    o	New plot peak function 'plotPeak'. The old function was renamed as
	plotPeakSimple. The function show also the regions in which the
	searches were performed to provide better quality controls.

BUG FIXES

    o	Changed to check.names=TRUE in 'read.delim' call in functions
	TargetSearchGUI() and ImportLibrary(). This prevents empty column names
	that might produce errors in downstream functions.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10.0:

NEW FEATURES

    o	New function "writeLibText" to save "tsLib" objects in a tab-delimited
	text file (which can consecuently be re-imported). It might be also used to
	convert a MSP file into a TEXT file.

BUG FIXES

    o   Added some 'drop=FALSE' in plotSpectra function.

    o	Calls to 'pdf' are now followed by 'on.exit(dev.off())' to make sure that
	the device is closed after unexpected errors or user interruption.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.2:

BUG FIXES

    o	bug fixed error due to changes in TargetSearch object definitions in
	function writeMSP.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.1:

BUG FIXES

    o	'sampleRI' and 'Profile' functions would return NA if the minPairCor
	parameter was greater than the number of samples.

    o	Change GUI message to a more suitable one.

    o	'FAMEoutliers' failed if only one sample was analyzed.

    o	'ProfileCleanUP' accepts a minPairObs parameter like 'Profile'

    o	The parameter minPairObs is now checked so that cannot take a value
	lower than 5 in 'sampleRI', 'Profile', and 'ProfileCleanUP' functions.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0:

NEW FEATURES

    o	The Retention Time information is now imported from the RI files.
	This means that the RT slot of the "tsMSdata" object contains the R.T.
	values (formerly it was just an empty slot).

BUG FIXES

    o	Several fixes, improvements, and code cleaning.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.3:

NEW FEATURES

    o	Function NetCDFPeakFinding: 'ppc' is now the default peak picking
	method.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.2:

BUG FIXES

    o	Bug creating a new library in GUI. Fixed.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.1:

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed bug in "[" method, "tsLib" object.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.7:

    o	Column Sample_Count of metabolite Profile renamed to
	Sample_Count_per_Mass.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.6:

NEW FEATURES

    o	ImportLibrary.tab() now have a new parameter 'libdata'.

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed bug with corrupted CDF files. Now TS will try to process it
	and issue a warning to the user.

    o	Fixed bugs in the GUI:
	- Quantitative masses were not loaded into the tsLib object.
	- Fixed bug ExcludedMasses parameter.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.5:

NEW FEATURES

    o	New method 'sampleData<-' for 'tsSample' class.

    o	New method 'libData<-' for 'tsLib' class.

DOCUMENTATION

    o	Vignette corrections and rewriting.

BUG FIXES

    o	plotFAME(): plot title changed to 'RI marker' to be consistent
	with the manual.

    o	Fixed examples that did not pass R CMD check.
	
    o	Object validation bug fixes and new checks (all classes).

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4:

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed GUI error that occurred when creating/editing a library.

    o	Fixed Write.Result() file format output: columns were missing and
	column names were wrong. The file format should be compatible with older
	versions.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3:

NEW FEATURES

    o	New function ImportSamplesFromDir. It makes easier to create a
	tsSample object from CDF files in a directory.

    o	A new GUI layout and new features: Now it is not required to
	have all the files in the working directory. Basline, Peak detection,
	and RI correction options gray out when 'Apex data' is selected.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2:

NEW FEATURES

    o	New 'tsProfile' and 'tsMSdata' definitions. Many functions were
	internaly changed to conform to the changes, however, the changes
	should be (more or less) transparent for the user.

    o	classes.R:
	- new 'quantMass' slot in class 'tsLib'
	- class 'tsMSdata': slots changed from matrix to list
	- class 'tsProfile': new slots profInt, profRI and ProfRT

    o	Function FindPeaks: Now the parameter refLib can be either a list
	or a 3-column matrix. If it is a list, the function will iterate for
	every component, given that the components are 3-column matrices.

    o	Function ImportLibrary: code changed to incorporate the 'quantMass'
	slot.

    o	methods-tsLib.R: new methods to access quantMass slot. Also, new
	methods profileInt, profileRI and profileRT to access slots profInt,
	profRI and ProfRT. New method as.list

    o	Write.Results: Same as before, but the parameter peakData was
	removed, since the raw data is now included in the 'tsProfile' object.

    o	The following files were changed to conform to the new definicions.
	No changes in terms of functionality: dayNorm.R, peakFind.R, plot.R,
	profile.R, profileCleanUp.R, and sampleRI.R.

    o	new function quantMatrix.

    o	Changes in the GUI. Now two new parameters are accepted: topMasses
	and ExcludedMasses.

		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1:

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed NetCDFPeakFinding and tsSample-class manpages because
	of an error caused by wrong regular expressions in the example
	section at check.

    o	CITATION file of TargetSearch paper at BMC bioinformatics.
