  abstract = {Motivation: Typical GC-MS-based metabolite profiling experiments may
	comprise hundreds of chromatogram files, which each contain up to
	1000 mass spectral tags (MSTs). MSTs are the characteristic patterns
	of similar to 25-250 fragment ions and respective isotopomers, which
	are generated after gas chromatography (GC) by electron impact ionization
	(EI) of the separated chemical molecules. These fragment ions are
	subsequently detected by time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS).
	MSTs of profiling experiments are typically reported as a list of
	ions, which are characterized by mass, chromatographic retention
	index (RI) or retention time (RT), and arbitrary abundance. The first
	two parameters allow the identification, the later the quantification
	of the represented chemical compounds. Many software tools have been
	reported for the pre-processing, the so-called curve resolution and
	deconvolution, of GC-(EI-TOF)-MS files. Pre-processing tools generate
	numerical data matrices, which contain all aligned MSTs and samples
	of an experiment. This process, however, is error prone mainly due
	to (i) the imprecise RI or RT alignment of MSTs and (ii) the high
	complexity of biological samples. This complexity causes co-elution
	of compounds and as a consequence non-selective, in other words impure
	MSTs. The selection and validation of optimal fragment ions for the
	specific and selective quantification of simultaneously eluting compounds
	is, therefore, mandatory. Currently validation is performed in most
	laboratories under human supervision. So far no software tool supports
	the non-targeted and user-independent quality assessment of the data
	matrices prior to statistical analysis. TagFinder may fill this gap.
	Strategy: TagFinder facilitates the analysis of all fragment ions,
	which are observed in GC-(EI-TOF)-MS profiling experiments. The non-targeted
	approach allows the discovery of novel and unexpected compounds.
	In addition, mass isotopomer resolution is maintained by TagFinder
	processing. This feature is essential for metabolic flux analyses
	and highly useful, but not required for metabolite profiling. Whenever
	possible, TagFinder gives precedence to chemical means of standardization,
	for example, the use of internal reference compounds for retention
	time calibration or quantitative standardization. In addition, external
	standardization is supported for both compound identification and
	calibration. The workflow of TagFinder comprises, (i) the import
	of fragment ion data, namely mass, time and arbitrary abundance (intensity),
	from a chromatography file interchange format or from peak lists
	provided by other chromatogram pre-processing software, (ii) the
	annotation of sample information and grouping of samples into classes,
	(iii) the RI calculation, (iv) the binning of observed fragment ions
	of equal mass from different chromatograms into RI windows, (v) the
	combination of these bins, so-called mass tags, into time groups
	of co-eluting fragment ions, (vi) the test of time groups for intensity
	correlated mass tags, (vii) the data matrix generation and (viii)
	the extraction of selective mass tags supported by compound identification.
	Thus, TagFinder supports both non-targeted fingerprinting analyses
	and metabolite targeted profiling.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics, in particular gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
	based metabolite profiling of biological extracts, is rapidly becoming
	one of the cornerstones of functional genomics and systems biology.
	Metabolite profiling has profound applications in discovering the
	mode of action of drugs or herbicides, and in unravelling the effect
	of altered gene expression on metabolism and organism performance
	in biotechnological applications. As such the technology needs to
	be available to many laboratories. For this, an open exchange of
	information is required, like that already achieved for transcript
	and protein data. One of the key-steps in metabolite profiling is
	the unambiguous identification of metabolites in highly complex metabolite
	preparations from biological samples. Collections of mass spectra,
	which comprise frequently observed metabolites of either known or
	unknown exact chemical structure, represent the most effective means
	to pool the identification efforts currently performed in many laboratories
	around the world. Here we present GMD, The Golm Metabolome Database,
	an open access metabolome database, which should enable these processes.
	GMD provides public access to custom mass spectral libraries, metabolite
	profiling experiments as well as additional information and tools,
	e.g. with regard to methods, spectral information or compounds. The
	main goal will be the representation of an exchange platform for
	experimental research activities and bioinformatics to develop and
	improve metabolomics by multidisciplinary cooperation.},

     NMR Suite 4.6. It is demonstrated here using two separate spectra
